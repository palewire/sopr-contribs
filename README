A script that fetches, parses and archives the XML data dumps of lobbyist's
political contributions published by The Senate Office of Public Records.
 
Zips files containing the XML are:
1. Downloaded and unzipped.
2. Parsed out into flat text files and stored in a timestamped folder structure.
3. Imported to a SQLite database.
 
The ultimate goal is for a series of SQL statements to scrub and cut the data
to account for flaws in the reporting system first uncovered by Bill Allison
and Anupama Narayanswamy of The Sunlight Foundation.
